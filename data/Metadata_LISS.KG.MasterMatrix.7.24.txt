List of abbreviations and units organized by column: 

A. Month: numerical list of months included in the dataset. May=1, June=2, July=3, August=4, October=5.

B. Month.N: month names

C. Site: sites are listed in the connotation used in the field and the lab. LM=low marsh, HM=high marsh, PH=phragmites australis. 1-5 are the site numbers corresponding to field sampling. 
	
D. Vegzone: vegetation Zone 

E. Site.N: site number is the number given to all 15 sites and is consistent in each month. LM sites are 1-5, HM sites are 6-10, and PH sites are 11-15.

F. Denit.Rate: denitrification rate in units of ng N/g dry soil. 

G. Log.Denit.Rate: log(10) of the denitrification rate.

H. N2O.Rate: N2O flux rate in units of ng N/g dry soil.

I. Log.N2O.Rate: log(10) of the N2O flux rate.

J. N2O.Yield: the fraction of denitrification that results in N2O production. Unitless.

K. Sqrt.Yield: the square root of N2O Yield. Unitless.

L. Soil.Moist: soil moisture content, calculated as (wet soil (g)-dry soil (g))/wet soil (g). Unitless.

M. Chloride: chloride concentrations from the IC, converted to units of mg Cl/g dry soil. 

N. Sulfate: sulfate concentrations from the IC, converted to mg SO4/g dry soil.
 
O. log.Chloride: log(10) of Chloride (column M).

P. cube.moist: the cube root of soil moisture (column L). 

Q. log.so4: log(10) of sulfate (column N).

R. nh4: ammonium concentrations from Smartchem, converted to units of mg/L/g dry soil.
 
S. log.nh4: log(10) of sulfate (column R).

T. B.Biomass: belowground biomass measured in soil cores. Missing a lot of data. UNITS?
